You can find some examples to locate the embed code below:   
  
#### Google Slides

Please replace "GOOGLE SLIDES SHARING LINK" to your own sharing link and keep quotation marks outside.

```
<iframe width="1200" height="800" frameborder="0" src="GOOGLE SLIDES SHARING LINK"> </iframe>
```

) in embed code section on CGDV.  
  
### Document

## Step 4 Upload your code file  
For this challenge, we require participants to submit codes that are used for data wrangling. Codes will be assessed during an initial Quality Assurance process to prevent any data misinterpretation.  

If you upload your visual using either *Source* or *Embed url* in Step 3, upload the code file to a file storage platform such as Google Drive. Copy and paste the shareable link into the Description box below. Please make sure anyone with the link can view and download the file. But don't give access to edit.  
    
If you upload your visual using *Document* in Step 3, upload the code file along with your visualization file.    
  
## Step 5 Upload a visual cover picture  
Upload a cover picture for your visual. Your cover picture along with your visulizaton title will be presented in the CGDV Library as a submission entry.  


## Step 6 Double check your submission
