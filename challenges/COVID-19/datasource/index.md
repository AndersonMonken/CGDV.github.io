## Pandemic Data Room
## A Resource Provided by The Center for Global Data Visualization

A Pandemic Data Room is a comprehensive global COVID-19 data repository created by a consortium of partners and led by QED Group to improve understanding of the impact of physical distancing policies on social behavior, disease rates, hospital utilization, and local/national economies. This initiative will generate critical information needed to adjust policies to control the outbreak. We hope to bring amazing talent to work on the data and generate new tools that can be used to manage and understand this pandemic.

In order that the Pandemic Data Room best reflects questions being asked among the global health and international development communities, we have created a portal where people can pose questions on COVID-19 they are looking to get answered. This question portal will be available to Data Challenge  participants and they can use it to generate ideas in creating compelling visualization and analysis tools. Please visit the portal here (link).  

Participate in the <a href="https://cgdv.github.io/challenges/COVID-19/" target="_blank">COVID-19 Data Challenge</a> using this data resource.


## COVID-19 Data Sources  
  
### Provided by our Partners  
* [Fraym](https://fraym.io/): Geospatial Data For Covid-19 Prevention and Crisis Response  

The risks posed by coronavirus are especially high for millions of people who live in low-and middle-income countries, where financial, medical equipment, and health personnel resources are highly constrained. 

To rapidly identify countries, cities and communities that exhibit the greatest risk of emergency cases and rapid transmission, Fraym provides access to relevant data layers including Emergency Case Risk Factors (Smoking prevalence, Elderly households, Body health - obesity, child stunting, child wasting) and Transmission Risk Factors (Population density, Household size, Occupation, Transportation modes, Hand Washing Practices).

CGDV has requested the above data layers for countries including Guatemala, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, and South Africa.

* [Geopoll](https://www.geopoll.com/): Coronavirus In Sub-Saharan Africa  

As a research organization that conducts remote research, GeoPoll takes an initiative to assist the global response to coronavirus. From March 10th – 13th, 2020, GeoPoll administered a survey on the knowledge of and perceptions towards coronavirus in South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria. The study was conducted among 1,350 respondents, nationally representative by location in each country and with a 50-50 gender split, and an age split of 33% ages 15-24, 35% ages 25-34, and 32% ages 35+.
