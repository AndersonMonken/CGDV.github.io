# CGDV COVID-19 Pandemic Data Room

In response to the global COVID-19 outbreak, CGDV has created the Pandemic Data Room, a compendium of COVID-19-related data from various reputable sources. We believe data and fact are essential to understand the pandemic in this difficult time. We encourage CGDV users to create useful, innovative and responsible visualizations using reliable data sources.

[Fraym](https://fraym.io/): Geospatial Data For Covid-19 Prevention and Crisis Response  

The risks posed by coronavirus are especially high for millions of people who live in low-and middle-income countries, where financial, medical equipment, and health personnel resources are highly constrained. 

To rapidly identify countries, cities and communities that exhibit the greatest risk of emergency cases and rapid transmission, Fraym provides access to relevant data layers including Emergency Case Risk Factors (Smoking prevalence, Elderly households, Body health - obesity, child stunting, child wasting) and Transmission Risk Factors (Population density, Household size, Occupation, Transportation modes, Hand Washing Practices).

CGDV has requested the above data layers for countries including Guatemala, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, and South Africa. Please find the downloadable raster files with high-resolution down to 1km2 [here](CGDV.github.io/challenges/COVID-19/source_PartnerProvided/).
