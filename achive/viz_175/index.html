        <b>Anemia</b> is a widespread public health problem associated with an
        increased risk of morbidity and mortality, especially in pregnant women
        and young children. It affects both developing and developed countries
        with major consequences for human health as well as social and economic
        development. Approximately 50% of the population suffers from
        ‘nutritional anemia’ as known in countries where meat consumption is
        low. In India, about 89 million children are anemic with the prevalence
        of anemia at around 70% in children aged 6–59 months. The highest
        prevalence of anemia has been observed in children less than 5 years. It
        has a variable impact on physical development and children show poor
        attentiveness, memory and academic performance. Iron deficiency is one
        of its most common causes. Besides iron, other nutrients such as
        vitamins A, E, and C also play a key role in formation and protection of
        red blood cell (RBC) by stimulating stem cells as well as by activating
        a number of antioxidant enzymes.

          <b>How to Read the Graph:</b> The intersection of regions on the
          x-axis and numbers ‘ranks’ on the y-axis depict the rank of 36
          region’s in India for ‘children with any anemia’; as you hover your
          mouse on these intersection points you can look at the % of children
          with anemia in that region and its current rank. The drop-down box in
          the legend allows you to compare ranks & percentage of ‘children with
          any anemia’ with the three distinct categories – 1) children with mild
          anemia, 2) children with moderate anemia and 3) children with severe
          anemia. E.g., For New Delhi, 59.7% children in the age group of 6-59
          months have anemia and it has a rank of 19 amongst 36 regions but in
          terms of children with mild anemia New Delhi fares better and has a
          little under 1 in 5 such cases with a rank of 4 amongst 36.
