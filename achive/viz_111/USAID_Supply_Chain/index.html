    <h1>USAID HIV/AIDS' Road to 90-90-90</h1>
    <p>
      USAID’s HIV and AIDS program has now been on the forefront of the global
      AIDS crisis for 30 years. USAID, through PEPFAR, is working to achieve the
      Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS' ambitious 90–90–90 global
      goals by 2020.

        USAID Antiretroviral (ARV) and HIV Lab Shipments to Supported Countries
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the beginning of 2008, total line item value of ARV by USAID to
        supported countries is $54M and HRDT is $11M. As per latest available
        numbers (Sep 2015), these numbers have considerably gone up and the total line item
        value of ARV by USAID to supporting countries is $1.4B and HRDT is
        $213M. <br />

    <p>
      The biggest supplier of ARVs has been SCMS (Supply Chain Management
      System) established in 2005 to serve the PEPFAR programs and since 2006
      has supplied ARVs worth over $1B to supported countries. Further drilling
      down the shipment value by supported countries, USAID has shipped over
      $350M of ARV and HIV lab supplies to Nigeria since 2006; closely followed
      by its shipment of ARV and HIV lab supplies of over $246M to Zambia during
      the same period. USAID’s focus on Nigeria is not only because it is one of
      the most populous country but also that its health statistics present a
      grim picture; it has the world’s second highest number of persons living
      with HIV/AIDS after South Africa.
