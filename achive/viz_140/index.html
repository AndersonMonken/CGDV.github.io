    <p>
      Kenya with a population of 51 million (2018 estimates) is also one of the
      most developed countries in East Africa. Followed by agriculture, forestry
      and fishing; manufacturing is the second largest sector and represents
      around 11% of its GDP. A deep-dive into its exports and imports of
      machinery and parts starting Q1 2015, one observes an expected seasonal
      pattern in its imports of machinery and parts peaking in (Q1-Q3) followed
      by a decline in the last quarter. When calculated as a % of imports,
      Kenya’s exports of machinery and parts is in the range of 2-5% in this
      period. Highest value of Kenya’s imports of machinery and parts has been
      KES 86.4 Million shilling in Q1 2017 and that of exports has been KES 4.3
      Million shilling in Q2 2016; trend being clearly indicative of a huge
      negative balance of trade here.
