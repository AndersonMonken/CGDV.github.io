        <b>Antenatal care</b>(ANC) or, prenatal care is a type of preventive
        healthcare that a pregnant woman receives during her pregnancy. Good ANC
        links the woman and her family with the formal health system, increases
        the chance of using a skilled attendant at birth and contributes to good
        health through the life cycle. But only half of women worldwide receive
        the recommended amount of care during pregnancy. Sub-Saharan Africa and
        South Asia have the highest rate of maternal mortality in the world and
        fewer women receive the recommended minimum four antenatal visits during
        pregnancy. In Uganda, only 47.6% of expectant mothers received the
        recommended minimum four antenatal visits by a skilled health
        professional in 2014. Using 2016 DHS data we observe that in Uganda, at
        21.2% Kampala has the highest percentage of expectant mothers who have
        Doctors as antenatal care providers during their pregnancy; the Eastern
        region is ranked the lowest with only 4.3% antenatal care providers as
        Doctors. The majority population, anywhere from 76%-93% relies on
        Nurses/ Midwife as the primary antenatal care providers across the
        country. Reliance on Auxiliary Nurse, Other Health Worker and
        Traditional birth Attendants is very low.

          <b>How to Read the Graph:</b> The intersection of regions on the
          x-axis and numbers ‘ranks’ on the y-axis depict the rank of 10
          region’s in Uganda for ‘antenatal care percentage’; as you hover your
          mouse on these intersection points you can look at the % of antenatal
          care with specific provider in that region and its current rank. The
          drop-down box in the legend allows you to compare ranks & percentage
          of antenatal care provided by 'doctor’ with other four distinct
          categories – 1) nurse/mildwife, 2) auxiliary nurse/mildwife, 3) other
          health worker and 4) traditional birth attendant. E.g., For Kampala,
          21.2% people receive antenatal care from a doctor and it has a rank of
          1 amongst 10 regions but in terms of people receive antenatal care
          from a nurse/mildwife Kampala has a percentage of 76.8% with a rank of
          10 amongst 10.

          Note:<br /><b>Percentage</b><sup>*</sup>: Percentage of live births in
          the five years preceding the survey whose source of antenatal care
          during pregnacy was a [doctor/ nurse or midwife/ auxiliary nurse/
          another type of health worker/ traditional birth attendant]
