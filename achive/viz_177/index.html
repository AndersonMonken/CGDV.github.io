        Traditional ideas about the roles of girls and women restrict their
        contributions to in a nations’ growth. Women in Kenya are
        underrepresented in decision-making positions and also have less access
        to education, land, and employment. To assess women empowerment in
        Kenya; this visual looks at women’s participation in decision-making in
        Kenya. It is perhaps the most direct measure of women's empowerment
        since it examines women's participation in crucial decision-making
        processes. The higher the score, the greater the indication of gender
        equity in decision-making. 64.1% women in Eastern Kenya (ranked highest)
        reported having a final say in all of the decisions compared to only
        41.8% women in Western Kenya (ranked lowest). In having a final say in
        their own health-care, 86.8% women in Central Kenya reported to have a
        final say with a rank of 1 whereas, North Eastern Kenya is ranked the
        lowest with only 63.3% women reported having a final say in their own
        health-care.

          <b>How to Read the Graph:</b> The intersection of regions on the
          x-axis and numbers "ranks" on the y-axis depict the rank of 8 region's
          in Kenya for "percentage of women who have the final say"; as you
          hover your mouse on these intersection points you can look at the % of
          women have say in with specific decisions in that region and its
          current rank. The drop-down box in the legend allows you to compare
          ranks & percentage of women who have the final say in any of the
          decisions with other four distinct categories – 1) None of the
          Decisions, 2) Own Health Care, 3) Making Large Purchases and 4) Visits
          to Family, Relatives, Friends. E.g., For Nairobi, 59.7% women have the
          final say in any of the decisions and it has a rank of 2 amongst 8
          regions but in terms of women who have the final say in own health
          care Nairobi has a percentage of 78.1% with a rank of 4 amongst 8.
