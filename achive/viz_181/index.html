          Under-five Deaths Declined over Last 30 Years among USAID Supported
          Middle-East Countries
        </h1>
        <p>
          Over the last two decades, the world has made considerable progress in
          reducing the mortality for children under 5 (per 1000 live births).
          Despite this, in 2017 alone, an estimated 6.3 million children and
          young adolescents died, mostly from preventable causes. Children under
          5 accounted for 5.4 million of these deaths, with 2.5 million deaths
          occurring within the first month, 1.6 million at age 1–11 months, and
          1.3 million at age 1−4 years. While the chances of survival have
          increased for all age groups since 2000, the risk of dying is the
          highest in the first month of life at an average rate of 18 deaths per
          1000 live birth. Other than pre-term birth complication, the four main
          causes of death for children under-5 are – Pneumonia, Sepsis,
          Diarrhoea and Malaria.
          <br />
          Looking at the last three decades the under-5 mortality rates in the
          USAID supported middle-east countries (per 1000 live births), all
          countries have shown an improvement but Yemen has been the most
          remarkable. Still the highest in the region, it has managed to bring
          down its under-5 mortality rate from over 120 per 1000 live births in
          1990 to 55.4 per 1000 live births in 2016. The proposed Sustainable
          Development Goals (SDGs) target for child mortality aims to end, by
          2030, preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of
          age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at
          least as low as 12 deaths per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality
          to at least as low as 25 deaths per 1,000 live births.
