          Ebola, a virus that causes severe bleeding, organ failure and can lead
          to death also known as Ebola virus disease (EVD) or, Ebola
          haemorrhagic fever (EHF) is an infectious disease. One can get EVD
          through direct contact with an infected animal (bat or nonhuman
          primate) or a sick or dead person infected with the virus. The Western
          African Ebola virus epidemic (2013–2016) has been the most widespread
          outbreak of Ebola in history—causing as many as 11,323 reported deaths
          along with socioeconomic disruption in the region, mainly in the
          countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. It has a high case
          fatality rate (CFR) with an average of about 50% and affects males and
          females equally.

        <p>
          On August 1, 2018, the Ministry of Health of the DRC reported an
          outbreak of Ebola virus disease in North Kivu Province. And since, the
          outbreak is continuing to spread in Eastern DRC with confirmed cases
          reported in 22 health zones of North Kivu and Ituri provinces
          (Alimbongo, Beni, Biena, Butembo, Kalunguta, Katwa, Kayina, Kyondo,
          Lubero, Mabalako, Mangurujipa, Masereka, Musienene, Mutwanga, Oicha,
          and Vuhovi zones in North Kivu; as well as Bunia, Komanda, Mandima,
          Nyakunde, Rwampara, and Tchomia zones in Ituri). This is the 10th
          Ebola outbreak in DRC since the virus was discovered in 1976 in DRC.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of May 31<sup>st</sup> 2019, the highest number of deaths at 417 in Katwa, 259 in Butembo, 199 in Mabalako, and 194 in Beni have been reported; all four are North Kivu provinces. Mandima from Ituri reported as many as 157 Ebola Cases as of June 12th. Looking at both the bottom charts, one gets a sense that the both cases and number of deaths really spiraled up in April 2019. One of the main reasons it has been so difficult to contain the disease is because it is spreading in a conflict zone. Some 120 armed groups hide in the jungle-matted hills in the east of the country; they make money smuggling minerals like gold and coltan, used in mobile phone batteries, or by plundering villages and stealing livestock. Complicating things further, the local population has little trust in the authorities and their ability to respond. Since the start of the outbreak, there have been over 100 attacks on health workers and Ebola treatment centres.

          No proven Ebola virus-specific treatment presently exists; however,
          measures can be taken to improve a patient's chances of survival.
