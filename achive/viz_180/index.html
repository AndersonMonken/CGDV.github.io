          Only less than 1% of the world’s water is suitable for drinking and
          water related disease cause 3.4 million deaths each year. Egypt has
          been suffering from severe water scarcity in recent years. Uneven
          water distribution, misuse of water resources and inefficient
          irrigation techniques have played havoc with its water security. Egypt
          has only 20 cubic meters per person of internal renewable freshwater
          resources, and relies heavily on the Nile River for its main source of
          water; it is the backbone of Egypt’s industrial and agricultural
          sector and is the primary source of drinking water for the population.
          But with country’s rapidly growing population, climate change and poor
          garbage and pollution management, the river has become disposed of
          contaminants that are life-threatening.

              This trend has been noticeable in the regions where from 2008 to
              2014, all regions had a really high percentage of using untreated
              water for drinking with only less than 8% population using treated
              water. But in 2014, we see a much higher percentage relying on
              using treated water for drinking. This has also reflected in the %
              of households using an appropriate treatment method for drinking
              water going up from 3.3% in 2008 to 10.6% in 2014.
