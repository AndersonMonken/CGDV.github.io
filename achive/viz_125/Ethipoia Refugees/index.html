      Ethiopia has a long history of hosting refugees and maintains an open-door
      asylum policy, giving humanitarian access and protection to those seeking
      refuge. According to a new UNHCR report, Ethiopia is now hosting more than
      900,000 refugees in 2018. More than 99 per cent of them originate from
      four countries: South Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea and Sudan.
